# Where do I start?

The hardest thing about starting anything new is wondering, "Where do I start?" "How does my idea, project, thing fit into this?"  

Initially, the system will require you to start a project and add your team members.  The term here, "Project" can be what you need it to be: team delineation ("Marketing Team", "Developer Team", "QA Team"), Specific Project, Product development, Department delineation, and/or Initiatives. 

The goal here is both accessible ***and*** successful project management. By incorporating some of the best practices of business and project management, such as design thinking, agile, and lean canvas, there come some linear steps. 

In all methodologies, we typically start:

1. Research  - identifying our target customer, what their needs/problems are, collecting knowledge about the project space
2. Idea  - developing ideas / solutions to our users' problems, ideas about how to scale or launch 
3. Milestones - how will we measure our progress? how do we know we're on track?
4. To Dos - create a list of to-dos that get the project to "done"

To learn more about these methodologies in Leantime click here: [Design Thinking](knowledge-base/product-validation.md), [Lean Canvas](knowledge-base/whatislean.md), &
[Agile](knowledge-base/agile.md)

If this is a new project, idea, or effort -- this is how we'd suggest to start -- knowing that these steps can be revisited as your project progresses, more information is learned or as portions finish and new ones start.

### What if I've already got an idea?
  
Odds are, this is likely the case.  Human beings are problem solvers; it's how we evolve and improve on things. We aim to make things better. The methodology here is not meant to confuse your process but rather it is here to validate it and increase successful outcomes.  

If you have an idea, start by listing it on the Idea Board.  Then we suggest that you go back to validate the idea in Research by creating a Research Board.Launching your idea with the end user in mind means you're less likely to fail.  You can then track and validate your development with these items still visible and part of the teams' mind.

So your order might look like:

1. Idea
2. Research / Validate 
3. Milestones
4. To Dos

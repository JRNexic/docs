# Integrations

## Slack, Mattermost
You can connect your project with your Slack, Mattermost or Zulip account. This will allow Leantime to post notifications to a channel of your choice.  The process to set up Slack or Mattermost is very similar and will be covered here.

Before you can connect Leantime to Slack or Mattermost you have to set up a webhook. 

Follow the instructions here to get an [Incoming Webhook URL](https://slack.com/help/articles/115005265063-Incoming-Webhooks-for-Slack) from Slack. 

Follow the instructions here to get an [Incoming Webhook URL](https://docs.mattermost.com/developer/webhooks-incoming.html#simple-incoming-webhook) from Mattermost. 

Once you have your webhook URL go to: "Projects" and click on the project you would like to connect. 

Next click the "Integrations" Tab.

On this page, add your webhook into the input field and click save. 

We send notifications to Slack on:

 - To-Do updates
 - Milestone updates
 - Idea updates
 - Research updates
 - New comments
 - New Files

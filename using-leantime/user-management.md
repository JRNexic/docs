 In the User Management screen, you'll see the names of the individuals on your projects, their email, role, and have the ability to delete.  As part of our
 subscription, you will also see on the top right the amount of roles you have left in your subscription plan.  
 
 Clicking into a person's name will allow you to edit their profile or you can click Add User to create a new one.

 In this example, we've clicked on Marcel's name.  In his view, you can change his name, role, email, and you can select the projects that he's assigned to.
 Click on the project name and the arrow to assign which side that project is on.  The left side shows the projects that can be assigned and the right side
 shows the projects actually assigned to the user.

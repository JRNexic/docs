# Agile in Leantime

Agility, in sports, refers to the ability to adapt quickly to a changing fast paced environment.  In sports, that may mean you need to be quick on your toes, have fast reflexes, good hand-eye coordination.  In business, or on a team, agility is incredibly similar.  Business requires pliability on projects, demands, delivery, change requests, and even life interruptions.  

## The Agile Manifesto

In agile product development, your efforts are focused around a set of principles or goal points.  The end result of all the development should include:

**1. Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools

**2. Working software** over comprehensive documentation

**3. Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation

**4. Responding to change** over following a plan

While all the above is important, the bold words are the priority.  These are the things that make us better at managing and putting out software.

### How does this relate to Leantime?

When we started building Leantime, we aimed to incorporate elements of the best methodologies.  The goal in Agile is to decrease the paperwork and focus on the build and people.  It's impossible to get rid of paperwork but we believed it could get simpler.  

### To deliver using agile: you deliver incrementally.  

There's no waiting for "done."  Projects are living things -- they move, you have to move with them.  Make a piece, ship a piece.  Make another piece, ship a piece.  To do this, agile utilizes methods such as Sprints, Kanban Boards, Backlogs, Retrospectives

but...

### agile doesn't start once the project does. It starts the moment the project is born into ideation.

Using agile in a project is important but why wait until we're in build mode?  In Leantime, you have the ability to use backlogs, plan sprints, have retrospectives, manage To Dos in Kanban format already.  Great.  You're agile.  But don't wait.  We use agile from the beginning by using Idea Boards and Research boards.  

We've taken the focus out of meetings and paperwork with the goal of making it more alive.  You can take that idea you have and post it in the board.  Not sure something is what the user needs?  Do some research.  Collaboration over negotiation, change management and thinking ahead, communication and build.

### More simply, agile is like side-scrolling through Super Mario

And then having to jump around the Koopas and Shy Guys, story-line interruptions, or with characters like Poochy taking you off through the level (in Super Mario 2, anyway).  

Agile is the focused effort to minimize falling down the hole while more deliberately holding down the run button through the level. You know, instead of running through the whole level... or playing with that one kid that had to walk the whole darned thing.  We've gotten all the coins already, really.  

You stop, collect the important parts and get to the deliverable end.  That's why we're here and what our goal is -- to get you through the product/project life cycle.

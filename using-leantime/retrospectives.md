# Retrospectives

Retrospectives are that important end piece to every Sprint and even great for the end of a milestone or project completion.  This is that final meeting
to talk about what went well, what didn't go so well, and what to change.  You can focus on all dimensions of a project 
and can include things such as: communication, delivery, planning, and workflow.

The screen above is the first screen you will see the first time you go to start a retrospective in every project.  Click *Start a Retrospective*.

From there, another pop up box will appear and ask you for the title of your Retrospective.  In this case, we continued the title from this sample project, 
"The Next Great Idea" but in reality, you could use a Sprint name, Dates, Milestones, or as this, a project name.   Click *Start*.

Adding More allows you to edit the title and place examples of what went well.  From this screen, you can also create a new milestone or attach to an existing 
one.  In this case, we've added an existing milestone.  Click *Save & Close*

Clicking *Save & Close* on the previous screen will take you back to the main board view.  Complete the remaining sections and you'll be ready
to review how things went.

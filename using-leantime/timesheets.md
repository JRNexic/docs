 ####Time Tracking
 
From the main Kanban view, you can click on the 3 dots on the top right corner of your task/to do box.  This will pull up the options to edit, delete or Start Work.  
Starting work will start a task timer that allows you to track the time spent on that effort and input it into your timesheet.

  Starting work will start a timer on the top of your screen next to *My Timesheet*.  Time is not tracked if work spent is less than 6 minutes long.

# Team Happiness & Productivity

Business pressure, timelines, budgets, changing requirements... all these things can become distractions towards productivity.  
Ironically, though, better productivity can relieve some of the "stresses" of product and business development.  So why not  
increase productivity?  

Create a happier team, create more productivity. 

#### What makes a team happier?

Research is starting to support the idea that teams of 5-10 people are more productive, have more engagement, more effective  
communication, innovate better, and are overall more supportive of each other.  While this isn't always possible in all organizations,  
breaking work into smaller functioning teams can improve morale and project outcomes.  When not available, managers can boost  
team morale by incorporating use of collaborative technologies (like Leantime), increasing visibility of objectives and goals,  
creating autonomy with monitoring output vs hours, and investing in employees.

No matter the team size, teams undoubtedly function better with better managers.  While you can't replace the skills of a good  
manager, you can have tools that make the work, team, and manager better and more effective.  

The goal of Leantime is to increase accessibility, visibility, and make managing work efficient.  When plans are clear,   
work is straight forward, autonomous and easy to communicate, then you've effectively set your projects up for team success.  
Leantime was built to move teams through the product life cycle rather than for product development to overtake the team.

#### Team Functions in Leantime

1. Increase Visibility:  See project status, work in progress, team member status, ideas, product research, and more in quick access.
2. Accessible: Straight forward, easy to use no matter the team member role or background.
3. Autonomous: Team members control their time and to do status.  
4. Communication: Discussion points are accessible throughout the Boards.
5. Retrospectives:  Acknowledge what the team did well, what could work better, and what they should keep doing. 

These things become even more important when teams are remote.  Regardless of team size, location, or work type, a happier  
team is possible and a happier team will create better.

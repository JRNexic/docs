# Agile in Leantime

###Synopsis of Agile

Agile is a software development methodology designed to create value in incremental chunks of development.  Rather than  
obtaining value when development is "done," agile is intended to utilize the fast paced iterative processes of Scrum & Kanban so that  
when development occurs, it does so in bite-able pieces that can be quickly adapted to changing requirements, functionality  
concerns or any other changes that may happen in the product life cycle.  In obtaining value, it allows for these bite-able  
pieces to be released and in use immediately.

### Kanban

Kanban, in agile, is the visualization of the activities / tasks needed to complete the development of the product/project.  
In Leantime, they are visualized in columns as: New, Blocked, In Progress, In Review, Done.  Within these columns,  
the tasks will be defined, assigned and will travel throughout the columns until they reach the Done category.  In Leantime,  
you'll also have an archived category that is not visualized on the board itself.

In Leantime, the Kanban view has been combined with some of the second component of agile: Scrum. 

### Scrum

Scrum is a process framework within agile that helps to guide the iterative process. The goal of which is to increase the  
 the quality of deliverables, improve change management (changing requirements, provide more realistic time estimates,  
 and offer more control over project/product dates and timelines.  While Scrum has quite a few working components, for our   
 purposes, we'll discuss the ones specific to Leantime.

### The Iterative Process: Sprints

A Scrum Sprint is a month long, or less, actionable push that is intended to finish with a quality deliverable, or   
releaseable product increment is created.  As part of the building process, one would create a actionable tasks, assign  
and incorporate into this release.  There are then tasks that remain as part of the product but are held for later Sprints.  
In Leantime, on the Kanban (To Do) view, you are able to create timed Sprints, associating specific tasks within it.  On the   
List view, you can see both the tasks in this Sprint and in Backlog (the tasks held for later Sprints).

### Retrospectives

Maintaining iteration must also include retrospection.  Improvements must be made in sequence with development otherwise  
any missteps, inefficiencies or problems may be missed or simply repeated.  At the end of a Sprint, a brief Retrospective  
period should be done.  In Leantime, there are boards that can be associated with Sprints.  It includes member feedback of  
what went well, what needs improvement, and what should be continued for the next sprint.  In Leantime, this is visualized  
in a similar Kanban format.

### Effort & Velocity

#####Effort
For Scrum, and product development in general, an estimation of effort required is useful in determining how much work and  
time is required to get to "Done".  As a general rule, there is often some difficulty in the accuracy of identifying  
how much time is required for a specific task or project.  Scrum then uses effort to describe the complexity of the project.   
Scrum calls this "Story Points."  In Leantime, these are "T-shirt Sizes."  T-shirt size is defined by the team as estimations  
within a task.  The team averages that a certain task is a "small" task and this second task is an "XL" task and so forth.

#####Velocity

Velocity is another important concept within Scrum.  It is the amount of work your team can accomplish in a single Sprint.  
To calculate Velocity, the amount of effort completed at the end of the Sprint is used.  This can then be used to measure  
and plan for outcome improvements and task/Sprint estimations.  In Leantime, velocity can be visualized under the Reporting  
Menu.
